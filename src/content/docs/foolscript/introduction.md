description: Write Code Like a Fool

> The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.

-William Shakespeare

FoolScript is a term to represent all programming languages. In the age of AI, it is no longer enough to know one or two languages. You need to know all of them...or at least be able to write code in all of them.

The FoolScript prompts are designed to help you code in all languages and frameworks using features built into VS Code (primarily the [reusable prompts feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental)).

After adding the FoolScript prompts to your project manually or with the [FoolScript CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/fools), you can use them in the VS Code Copilot Chat window by typing `#` followed by the name of the prompt file.

Each prompt aims to make the built-in copilot model provide an outline of a generic coding concept for the current language. There are prompts for declaring variables, creating classes, writing functions, and more.

## Why FoolScript?

I forget things, simple things, all the time. As AI coding tools have become more popular, the number of languages I've used to create software has grown. I can't remember all the syntaxes, framework idiosyncrasies, or best practices for each language. Nor should I need to. I'm a fool, after all.
