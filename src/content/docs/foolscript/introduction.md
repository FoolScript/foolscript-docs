> The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.

-William Shakespeare

FoolScript is a system designed to help you code in all languages and frameworks using features built into VS Code.

I forget things, simple things, all the time. As AI coding tools have become more popular, the number of languages I've used to create software has grown. I can't remember all the syntaxes, framework idiosyncrasies, or best practices for each language. Nor should I need to. I'm a fool, after all.
