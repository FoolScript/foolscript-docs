Follow the instructions on the Appwrite package page. Add the following section to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<activity android:exported="true"
            android:name="com.linusu.flutter_web_auth_2.CallbackActivity">

                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="appwrite-callback-[PROJECT ID]" />
            </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Click on the client you just created and:
1. Copy the client ID into your Appwrite console
2. Copy the client secret into your Appwrite console

### Apple Sign In
On the Auth tab in the Appwrite console, enable the Apple sign in method.

**Bundle ID**:
This is actually the _Service ID_ you will create below.

**Key ID**:
Sign into your Apple developer console and navigate to the [Keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) section. Create a new key and enable the Sign in with Apple capability. Copy the Key ID and paste it into your Appwrite console.

**P8 file**:
Download the P8 file from the same page and upload it to your Appwrite console. You can open it in a text editor to copy the contents.

**Team ID**:
Copy your Team ID from the [Membership](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership) section of the Apple developer console and paste it into your Appwrite console.

1. On the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) tab, add a new identifier and select "Service IDs". 
2. Create a new service ID and enable the Sign in with Apple capability. 
3. Configure the Sign In with apple capability and add the redirect URI from your Appwrite console.

> This Service ID is the "Bundle ID" you will use in your Appwrite console ðŸ™ƒ

**Troubleshooting**
If you are seeing an error that says "OAuth provider failed to return email", you may need to [reset your Apple ID for your app](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65518275/12806961):

1. iPhone Settings
2. Apple ID
3. Password & Security
4. Apple ID Logins
5. Your App
6. Stop using Apple ID
