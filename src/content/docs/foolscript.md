description: A wise fool's guide to software development
---

FoolScript is a collection of templates, tools, guides, and resources I've accumulated over the years to kickstart my software projects.

The [FoolScript app template](/template/introduction) is the primary product of my time as a Flutter developer. It contains a cross-platform Flutter app, a mobile app landing page, and an admin module in one monorepo. You can get access to the code by [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/jtmuller5) ☕️

The [FoolScript playbooks](/playbook/app) are concise, step-by-step guides for releasing different types of software, ranging from Flutter applications to Astro docs to VS Code extensions. If I've had to do it more than once, I've created a playbook that I continue to optimize over time.

The FoolScript tools are a collection of random things I've created over time to make my life as a developer easier. These include VS Code extensions, code snippets, standalone websites, and more.
